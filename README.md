* Import module (support python module)
* if, elif and else
* function
* while and for loop

# How it work?
* It process every characters
* It doesn't care about line and indent but care about semicolon
* It convert the PythonScript code to Python and execute it

# The difference
```py
# You can't do
this

print("

```
but
```pys
#{
    PythonScript was able to do this
}
printCon("

");
printCon("Also semicolon is important");
printCon("While for the last line is optional")
