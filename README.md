# How it work?
* It process every characters
* It doesn't care about line and indent but care about semicolon
* It convert the PythonScript code to Python and execute it

# The difference
```py
# You can't do
this

print("
also this
")
```
but
```pys
#{

}
printCon("
and also this!
");
printCon("Also semicolon is important");
printCon("While for the last line is optional")
