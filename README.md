****
### yes this is a joke but also it can't be

****
# To do:
* Variable
* Import module
* if, elif and else
* function
* while and for loop
* eval
* Fix code for better performance

## I can't do all that things alone, but maybe you can help me

****
# How it work?
* It process every characters
* It doesn't care about line and indent but care about semicolon
* It convert the PythonScript code to Python and execute it

# The difference
```py
# You can't do
this

print("
also this
")
```
but
```pys
#{
    PythonScript was able to do this
}
printCon("
and also this!
");
printCon("Also semicolon is important");
printCon("While for the last line is optional")
```
