### yes this is a joke

# Requirements:
* PyPy
    * For performance reason

****
# To do:
* Variable
* Import module
* if, elif and else
* function
* while and for loop
* eval
* Fix code for better performance

## I will be happy if you can help me do  that all functions :)

# How it work?
* It process every characters
* It doesn't care about line and indent but care about semicolon
* It convert the PythonScript code to Python and execute it

# The difference
```py
# You can't do
this

print("
also this
")
```
but
```pys
#{
    PythonScript was able to do this
}
printCon("
and also this!
");
printCon("Also semicolon is important");
printCon("While for the last line is optional")
```
